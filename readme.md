# Alchemy

Alchemy is a modern, extremely simple, and easy to customize static site generator.

## But wait! Another static site generator?

There are tons of awesome static site generators out there, like next.js, Gatsby, and Jekyll, all of which are absolutely awesome for what they do. Next.js and Gatsby are great for shipping React apps, and Jekyll for shipping Markdown apps.

While building a huge Jekyll site (thousands of pages), I was dissapointed with the difficulty of customization and the lousy performance when building. This problem triggered me to build my own simple and fast generator.

Built with node.js, markdown-it, and ejs, Alchemy allows for extremely simple content creation as well as rich templating support with layours and includes.

## Themes

Currently we only have one theme: a clone of Jekyll's default theme Minima, but you are able to create your own theme easily.
